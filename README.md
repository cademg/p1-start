Project 1

The software used was python with numpy and matplotlib libraries.

The project files can be accessed by going to github and finding my profile, which has my repositories listed. You can click on p1-start and find all of the files and code created for the project.

Running the program can be done through a terminal with python. The code is written out in the file plot.py and can be modified at will to suit the needs of the individual accessing the code. If one runs the code with a dataset as the argument then the code should run.

A successful run of the code should produce a graph of the data, a linear fit, and a calculation of the young's modulus of whatever material is being analyzed.

I learned that python is not very picky about syntax, but git is and I received a lot of syntax errors while messing around in git. Other than that, it was a positive learning experience, but I required a lot of help to get through it. For the small parts that I completed by myself I am very proud of, and of the portions that I received help for I am very thankful for the kindness and selflessness of my peers and instructors.
